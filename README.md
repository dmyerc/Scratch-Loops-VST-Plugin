# Scratch-Loops-VST-Plugin
The goal of this plugin is to combine something similar to the Ableton Sampler, Arpeggiator, and Chord Audio/Midi effects into one plugin. With this unique combination the user can upload any sound they like. Then create advanced rhythms and scales that will loop infinitely.
